===============

This demo site shows how Perch can be added to an existing website, or added simply without changing your current workflow.

We start with a set of HTML files and then add Perch Regions and create templates ot manage the content.

The site also includes the official blog and forms apps. The development of this site is detailed in our step by step tutorial. This is a great starting point if you are new to Perch.

The Swift Migrations site was designed for Perch by Laura Kalbag.
